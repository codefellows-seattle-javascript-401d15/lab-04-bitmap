## Description

This application will open and read a bitmap image into a buffer, copy the data as an object, run a transform on the buffer, and write the buffer to a new file. This application has three bitmap transform options: Greyscale, Invert, Color scale. This application uses node buffers in order to manipulate binary data.

## Installation

This application requires Node.js. Install the application dependencies and run the command:

```
node index.js or npm start

Also comment in the transform you want to use in the readWrite.js
```
