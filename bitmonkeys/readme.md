# Bit Monkeys
Code Fellows: Code 401: Class: 301d15

Week 1 Project: April 20, 2017

## Description
For this assignment we built a Bitmap reader and transformer. It reads a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then writes it out to a new file. This project uses node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. The project includes tests.
